	The Jesuit Order was founded by St. Ignatius Loyola in the 16th century. Formerly a soldier, he took to the cause of serving humanity. When a career in the military under a monarch was shed by him, he took up the more worthy cause of becoming a soldier of Jesus Christ possessed with a single vision of establishing a world of humanity and justice.

	St. Ignatius Loyola had a keen desire to spread education and knowledge, mediums of liberation for a just and equitable society. His ideals preserved and practiced in the most reverential manner form the bedrock of the Jesuits to this day. Around 20,000 Jesuits in the world are committed to the cause of spreading higher education.

	Students who enrol in St. Josephs College are instilled with a unique combination of appropriate attitudes and empathy along with skill sets and high levels of competence. Our students are expected to not merely excel but also imbibe in this excellence deep-seated virtues of service to humanity.</p1>
